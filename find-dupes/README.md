# Find duplicate endpoint pages

This utility supports the Microsoft Graph for Intune documentation; it searches a `/resources` for duplicate endpoint pages.  

The documentation is generated by a separate utility that does not yet fully account for the various workflows defined in the metadata.  As a result, multiple reference pages can be generated for a given endpoint.  (The overall goal is to make this utility obsolete; that work continues.)

This utility searches for such duplicates and its results are used to clean up the drop files accordingly.

The project is in active development.
