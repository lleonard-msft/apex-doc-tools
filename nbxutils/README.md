# Node build tools ()

This is a node.js module used in many of my Node projects; it provides support routines that I use on a regular basis.

I haven't fully integrated the module into a distributable package, partly because it's still a work-in-process and partly because I'm not entirely convinced there's a use for the module outside of my own work.

You'll notice that each project that uses nbxutils has a slightly different version.  (This is a reflection of the organic nature of these tools.)

This version is meant to be the canonical version, the one you use when starting a new project.
