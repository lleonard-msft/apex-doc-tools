# API.MD to Markdown pages

This utility supports C++ documentation projects created with Doxygen, which is a great parser, but doesn't provide HTML output that easily integrates into other formats or presentations.

This tool supports Moxygen, a tool that converts Doxygen XML output to one massive Markdown file called `api.md`.  It parses the single files into separate files (by class) and cleans up some rather funky formatting decisions that appear to be hardcoded into Moxygen itself.

Moxygen was recommended as conversation tool and testing showed we either needed to a) write a new tool or b) massage the output so that it was more suitable for out environment.  We chose the latter and this tool is the result.

The project is in active development.

## Running the tool

This tool is run as part of a larger process

1.  Run Doyxgen to parse your C++ project to XML output.

2.  Run Moxygen against the XML generated by Doxygen.

3.  Run api2pages against the `api.md` file created by moxygen.

    The required command-line parameter should point to the `api.md` file to be processed.

4.  Copy the `.\output\*.md` files to the source folder for your publishing process.

## Managing links

Both Doxygen and Moxygen do some odd things with links, which are basically unusable once they get to `api.md`.  The `link-config.json` file helps manage that by replacing link targets with preferred results.

When new links are detected, they're added to the configuration file and a relevant message is written to the console once the utility finishes.

The current implementation is a prototype and will likely change shortly.
