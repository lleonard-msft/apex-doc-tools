// This file helps debug the link target replacement code.  This 
// implementation is pretty simple and uses two arrays: one with the 
// old value and one with the new value at the same index location.  
//
// When you run the utility over time, new links are added to the 
// bottom of the oldTargets array; the idea is to manually add 
// replacement values to the same locations in the newTargets
// array. Sorting the arrays is not a good idea, unless you're 
// careful to maintain the correspondences 
//
// If it a link is valid, simply re-use the oldTarget value, shown
// below.
//
// Yes, it's brittle and improvements are planned, but haven't been 
// implemented (time constraints).
