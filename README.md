# APEX documentation tools

This project collects a variety of tools, utilities, scripts, and one-shots I've written to support documentation projects for Microsoft's Azure Platform Experiences team.  

It's a bit of a grab bag, honestly.  But, I wanted to share them in case anyone else is trying to solve similar problems.  (I also wanted to have a backup in case anything happens to my machine.)

Each directory provides a separate tool, though some tools are designed to run in conjunction with others.

There may be interesting bits of code, but most of it is designed to be utilitarian.  These are generally written under deadline pressure and are maintained as needed.  

Consider them works-in-progress.
